```
The function objToTree receives a JavaScript object and creates a visual tree-like representation of it.

For example, this object:

example = {
  "a": {
    "b": {
      "c": null,
      "d": {
        "e": null
      },
    },
    "f": null
  }
}

Is converted to this tree:

a
├── b
│   ├── c
│   └── d
│       └── e
└── f

There are 6 + 1 cases to cover, all other variations of smaller or larger trees can be derived from these recursively:

0. root

root
├── 1. branch
└── 2. leaf

root
├── branch
│   ├── 3. branch of branch
│   └── 4. leaf of branch
└── leaf

root
└── leaf
    ├── 5. branch of leaf
    └── 6. leaf of leaf

The initial object needs to be in a particular format:

 every 'key' should be unique
 every 'value' should be either an 'object' or 'null'
```
